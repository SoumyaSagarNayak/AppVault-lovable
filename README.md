# App Vault - Your Personal Productivity Hub 🔐

App Vault is a sleek, minimal, and secure web-based hub for managing your personal productivity — including links, PDFs, passwords, and tasks — all in one beautifully designed interface.

## 🔧 Features

- Organize your links, files, and tasks with ease  
- Clean and responsive UI using React + Tailwind CSS  
- Powered by shadcn-ui for modern component design  
- Built with Vite and TypeScript for blazing-fast performance

## 🚀 Built with AI, *Customized by Me*

This project started as an experiment using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev), a no-code AI-powered tool that helps kickstart full-stack apps.

But I didn’t stop there — I went under the hood, **edited the code, adjusted layouts, cleaned up components, and made key changes** to better match my vision and needs.

I love exploring new AI tools like Lovable, not just to build fast, but to **understand, learn, and make them truly mine.** 🧠⚡
